# Hidden Markov Model

Similar to that implemented in Hampton et al. (2006) J Neurosci  
[here](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/32/8360)  

Discrete emission probabilities for binary outcomes

Currently fits MLE (uniform prior) which as better identifiability than mis-specified priors

# Upcoming (message me if interested)
Modified to allow for a continuous Gaussian emission distribution  
Separately fit mean and variance parameters of emission distribution
MAP estimate
